"""
This module contains unit tests for the Calculations class, which manages 
a history of Calculation instances. The tests cover the following functionalities:
- Adding a calculation to the history
- Retrieving the last calculation from the history
- Retrieving the entire history
- Clearing the history

Each test ensures that the Calculations class behaves as expected in different scenarios.
